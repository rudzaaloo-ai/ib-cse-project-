Specification: 
What program does
This program is essentially a quiz, people input their specific preferences, and my program tells them which Hogwarts house they suit best. The data I fed it to analyse which house suits the person best, is from my own knowledge of the characteristics of each hogwarts house. 


What problem it solves
People that really wish to experience the hogwarts universe, get to use this quiz as a little excerpt of experience into that world. I have wished to make this ever since I was small and read the Harry Potter series. 


What the user is supposed to input and get as output
The user must input one of the alphabets a, b, c or d. Incase the input is accidentally a capital letter, the list for “answers” append a lowercase edit, which turns all inputs into lowercase just incase. The backend output to the program is that there is a function that saves and returns the users chosen alphabets. Each alphabet when picked once, adds +1 to the “account” of each variable of the hogwarts house. Then, another function sees which house variable has ended up with the highest amount of points.  Finally, the output for the user is that these final highest scores function is returned and presents to the user which house they belong to.

Stuff about the quiz
It has 5 questions so it is inevitable to get one house, the user cant just get 1 point for each account and make the program redundant 
The reason functions 2 and 3 for example are not combined are honestly purely for the code to be more organized and less messy, as then function 2 would have to return 2 different things with more instructions 


this is essentially the exact same documentation pdf lol
